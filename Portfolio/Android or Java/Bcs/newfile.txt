seperateOfficers() – This method first initialised some variables for
the reading of the <b>bcs.txt</b> file and then set up some regular expression patterns
(Java Regular Expressions, Refsnes Data) for the processing of each line read 
from <b>bcs.txt</b>. Next, the PrintWriter class was used to make each file available 
for writing to. Each pattern was then matched to the word using the .matcher() 
method of each pattern. (Java Regular Expressions, Refsnes Data) 
The .find() method of each pattern was then used in if statements to check 
which pattern matches with the UB number and therefore that corresponding file 
was written to and that corresponding <i>officerCount</i> was incremented. 
If it didn’t match any pattern, then a suitable message was outputted and the 
line wasn’t appended to any of the files, nor any of the <i>officerCount</i> 
attributes incremented. It did this until it reached the end of the file 
(<i>line</i> equal to <b><i>null</i></b>) in a do-while loop. 
It also included exception handling and error logging. 

closeFiles() – This method firstly initialises an array of integers of 
length 4 for the <i>officersCount</i> attributes. 
Then it uses exception handling to close the files, catching and 
logging any errors that arise from this. It also uses exception handling 
to insert the <i>officersCount</i> attributes into their respective 
positions in the array and to output them, catching and logging any 
errors arising from this also. 
Finally, it returns the <i>officersCountList</i>.

The attribute storing the first outputFile as a file object for. 
Used in openFiles() to open a new file.

An integer storing the officers count for the year 2021. 
This is incremented in separateOfficers() and displayed in closeFiles().

The attribute storing the PrintWriter object for the logger file. 
Used in openFiles() to open the logger file.

The attribute storing the PrintWriter object for the first output file. 
Used in separateOfficers() to allow writing to the output file for the year 2021 in conjunction with the outputFile1 attribute.
